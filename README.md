## SimpleStories
[SimpleStories](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lennart-finke/SimpleStories) is an attempt to improve [TinyStories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07759), and provide a dataset for training tiny, interpretable language models. See [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09184) and the [demo website](https://fi-le.net/simplestories/). We also provide code for [Model Training](https://github.com/danbraunai/simple_stories_train).

## Usage
`oai_batch.py` provides functionality to recreate the dataset cost effectively with the OpenAI Batch API.
