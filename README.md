## ðŸ“˜ðŸ“• SimpleStories ðŸ“™ðŸ“—
[SimpleStories](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lennart-finke/SimpleStories) is a collection of model-generated short stories. It was made to train small, interpretable language models. SimpleStories is inspired by [TinyStories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07759). 

See [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09184) and the [demo website](https://fi-le.net/simplestories/). We provide code for [model training](https://github.com/danbraunai/simple_stories_train) as well.

When using SimpleStories in your work, please cite the [SimpleStories data paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09184):

## Usage
`oai_batch.py` provides functionality to recreate the dataset cost effectively with the OpenAI Batch API.

### Features
- Story annotation with high-level concepts: `theme`, `topic`, `style`, etc.
- Higher semantic and syntactic diversity through seeded story generation
- Generated by 2024 models
- Several NLP-metrics pre-computed to aid filtering
- ASCII-only guarantee for the English dataset
- Multilingual, with versions available in:
  - [English](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lennart-finke/SimpleStories)
  - [Japanese](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lennart-finke/SimpleStories-JA)
  - And more in the future, hopefully!
